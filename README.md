## WikiLink checker
The WikiLink checker, checks for broken links, within all markdown files.
A broken link can be a markdown file, an anchor or image files.
If the broken WikiLink is a markdown file, you can add the file to the referenced location.
The WikiLink checker, also tries to find alternative locations, by searching the Wiki (project) for matching filenames. It lists the alternative files, so you can link to one. Furthermore you can easily navigate to each broken WikiLink to manually change it.

## WikiSearch
The WikiSearch is somehow like the built-in search, but only searches in markdown files.
The representation of the results is also different. The WikiSearch keeps your search results in the panel (search history), so can keep track of your searches. And of course you can click an entry to navigate to the result.
